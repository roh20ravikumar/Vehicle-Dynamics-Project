# Vehicle Dynamics Project
Vehicle Dynamics Modeling for a rear-wheel steered vehicle

## My contribution:
1. Developed the equations of motion for a rear-steered bicycle model, which included lateral, yaw, and roll dynamics, and a nonlinear tire
model and simulated it using the fishhook maneuver on MATLAB and compared the performance with a front-wheel steered vehicle by
using static stability derivatives.
2. Devised a strategy for a 2-axle steering vehicle using the rear wheel steer angle as the control variable and the front wheel steer angle
making the vehicle neutral steer.
